## getting started

first you are going to run

# npm run build

then you are going to go into the

### /Users/chamathigamage/src/aws/testapp/main.tf

and at line 3

### bucket = "slightly-different-s3-terraform-bucket-cham"

change the name inside of the string to your own bucket name

## ie: bucket = "this-is-my-own-bucket-name"

make sure u replace all instances of "slightly-different-s3-terraform-bucket-cham" in this file(line 38)

then it should work i think
